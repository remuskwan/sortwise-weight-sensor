# HOW TO CALCULATE THE REFFERENCE UNIT
1. Set the reference unit to 1 and make sure the offset value is set.
2. Load you sensor with 1kg or with anything you know exactly how much it weights.
3. Write down the 'long' value you're getting. Make sure you're getting somewhat consistent values.
    - This values might be in the order of millions, varying by hundreds or thousands and it's ok.
4. To get the wright in grams, calculate the reference unit using the following formula:
        
    referenceUnit = longValueWithOffset / 1000
        
In my case, the longValueWithOffset was around 114000 so my reference unit is 114,
because if I used the 114000, I'd be getting milligrams instead of grams.
